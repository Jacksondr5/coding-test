- Icebreaker test: look at some existing code and give it a PR review. Make the changes you suggest.
- Junior API test: fetch data from a GET API and display it. Consider making the data somewhat more complex than the last GET test.
- Form test: create a small form and submit it to a POST API. The form should have at least 3 fields. We can jut make our own API endpoint for this in the NextJS server.
  - basic data submission
  - data validation
  - make the form look pretty
- NextJS test: create a new page to display basic bank account information. Have them fetch the data in NextJS methods, choosing the right one. Maybe give them a Figma file for it.
- E2E testing test: Write a PW test for the form you just created.s
