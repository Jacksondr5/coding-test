# First Horizon Coding Test

Welcome to the First Horizon Coding Test. The purpose of this interview is to give you an opportunity to show us your coding skills. You'll have about an hour to complete various coding tasks that we provide you.

## Getting Started

1. Run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies. While this is running, we will go over the rest of this README and show you the structure of the repo.
2. Run `pnpm dev` to start the dev server.
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.

## Structure

This repo is a Next.js app created using `create-next-app`. It's set up to use TypeScript, Tailwindcss, and the Next.js App router. The code you'll be working with is all in the `src/components` directory. Everything else is boilerplate code we've set up to make it easier for you to get started. The `components` folder contains a file for each test where you'll write your code.

## Taking the Tests

Once the dev server is running, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app. You'll see a list of all the tests we have. We'll tell you which test to start with and you'll navigate to the test by clicking the card. Each test will have a description of what you need to do and your code will appear on the screen.

## Important Notes

Before you get started, there are a few things you should know:

- These tests are NOT designed to trick you. They should look like normal coding tasks you might encounter in your day-to-day work. The code will build and run, we're just looking for you to add new features to it.
- It will take longer than an hour to complete all of the tasks. We designed it this way so that we can move between tests and see how you solve different problems, or focus in on a particular area if we want to see more. Because of this, we may ask you to stop what you're doing and move on to another task. That doesn't mean you're behind or that you're doing poorly. It's just part of the process.
- You're free to use Google to look up syntax or functions. We're not testing how well you memorized things, we're testing your problem solving skills. Please let us know what you plan to look up ahead of time. We want to make sure you're not looking up the answer to the problem we're asking you to solve.
- Please turn off any AI code completion tools you may have.
